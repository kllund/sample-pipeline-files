# This sample config.yml shows how to configure a CircleCI workflow to analyze a repository using the CodeQL Runner
# The example assumes a simple Java application built using Maven

# Assumes an existing GitHub Apps or personal access token: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token stored as pipeline variable GITHUB_TOKEN
# Currently this workflow runs on commit, you will need to setup triggers for workflow to run on certain branches, PR, scheduled, etc.

  # STEP 1 (OPTIONAL): Download CodeQL Runner
  # The CodeQL Runner can either be download as part of the pipeline,
  # or pre-downloaded and placed on the CI/CD build machine(s). If pre-downloading, replace ./codeql-runner-linux in subsequent stages with the absolute path to the download location.
  - wget https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/latest/download/codeql-runner-linux
  - chmod +x codeql-runner-linux #Give CodeQL Runner executable access

  # STEP 2: Initialize the CodeQL Runner
  # Assumes an existing GitHub Apps or personal access token: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token stored as pipeline variable
  # Full documentation for init step: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/configuring-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system#init
  # In this example, the security-extended suite is used, which includes both security queries and code quality queries
  - echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | ./codeql-runner-linux init --repository org/repo --github-url https://github.com --queries security-extended --github-auth-stdin
  
  # STEP 3: Set BUILD step environment variables (only required for compiled languages)
  # Set the generated environment variables so they are available for subsequent commands
  # This script created as part of the ./codeql-runner-linux init step and referenced in init logs
  - . ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}/codeql-runner/codeql-env.sh # REMOVE this step if you are not scanning any compiled languages (ex. Java) and only scanning scripting languages (ex. JavaScript)
  
  # STEP 4: Build codebase (only required for compiled languages)
  # Example 1: Use the AutoBuilder
  # The CodeQL Runner comes with a sopfisticated AutoBuilder, which attempts to build the code based on files in the repository
  # Full documentation for autobuild step: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/configuring-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system#autobuild
  - ./codeql-runner-linux autobuild --language java # REMOVE this step if you are not scanning any compiled languages (ex. Java) and only scanning scripting languages (ex. JavaScript)
  # Example 2: Providing manual build command
  # Alternatively, we can run the build command to compile the code. In this example, we have a simple maven project with a pom.xml in the root of the repository, and a settings file in a subdirectory
  # For Code Scanning purposes, we only need to compile the code. As such, we disable executing our test suite. This can be changed according to your needs      
  # command: 'mvn clean install -DskipTests=true -s settings/settings.xml'   

  # STEP 5: Analyze CodeQL database and send results to GitHub 
  # Analyze the snapshot database created as part of the build, by running the selected queries against it
  # Assumes an existing GitHub Apps or personal access token: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
  # Full documentation for analyze step: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/configuring-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system#analyze
  # Once the analysis is done, the results will be uploaded to GitHub
  # Specifying the --ram attribute puts a ceiling on memory resources used by CodeQL runner, use this if you experience errors where CodeQL runner runs out of memory resources
  - echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | ./codeql-runner-linux analyze --repository org/repo --github-url https://github.com --commit $TRAVIS_COMMIT --ref refs/heads/main --github-auth-stdin
