# This sample config.yml shows how to configure a CircleCI workflow to analyze a repository using the CodeQL Runner
# The example assumes a simple Java application built using Maven

# Assumes an existing GitHub Apps or personal access token: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token stored as pipeline variable GITHUB_TOKEN
# Currently this workflow runs on commit, you will need to setup triggers for workflow to run on certain branches, PR, scheduled, etc.

          # Example 1: Use the AutoBuilder
          # The CodeQL Runner comes with a sopfisticated AutoBuilder, which attempts to build the code based on files in the repository
          # Full documentation for autobuild step: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/configuring-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system#autobuild

          command: ./codeql-runner-linux autobuild --language java
          # Example 2: Providing manual build command
          # Alternatively, we can run the build command to compile the code. In this example, we have a simple maven project with a pom.xml in the root of the repository, and a settings file in a subdirectory
          # For Code Scanning purposes, we only need to compile the code. As such, we disable executing our test suite. This can be changed according to your needs      
          # command: 'mvn clean install -DskipTests=true -s settings/settings.xml'
